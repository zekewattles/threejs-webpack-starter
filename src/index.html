                Commemorating 50 years of Land Art, the Nevada Museum of Art
                convenes its triennial 2021 Art + Environment Season on the
                subject of Land Art: Past, Present, Futures. The three-month
                season of virtual programs brings together prominent artists,
                art historians, and critics who have shaped the pioneering
                genre, alongside interdisciplinary scholars, artists, and social
                activists who are exploring ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù as they push the
                boundaries of the field.

                While much of the global art world remains enchanted by the
                monumental Earthworks that emerged in the American West in the
                late 60s and 70s, there is concurrent interest among
                contemporary artists, scholars, and social activists who
                critique, contextualize, perform, and engage in environmental
                and social dialogue about art of the land.

                Between Walter De Maria and Michael Heizer, Nevada is home to at
                least fifteen significant Land Art interventions created since
                1968. It is this Land Art tradition upon which the Nevada Museum
                of Art established its Center for Art + Environment&mdash;a
                research center, archive, and library&mdash;in 2008. This Land
                Art tradition also led to the museum‚Äôs partnership with Swiss
                artist Ugo Rondinone and Art Production Fund to coproduce and
                present Seven Magic Mountains in 2016, one of the twenty-first
                century‚Äôs most significant public art projects, just outside Las
                Vegas. During the past decade, the museum has engaged in
                significant Land Art projects with contemporary artists
                including Lita Albuquerque, Judy Chicago, Chris Drury, Helen and
                Newton Harrison, Daniel McCormick & Mary O‚ÄôBrien and Trevor

                Featuring over 50 large-format photographs by renowned
                photographer Gianfranco Gorgoni (1941‚Äì2019), this exhibition
                includes iconic images of many first-generation Earthworks in
                the American West. After meeting the legendary New York gallery
                owner Leo Castelli in 1969, Gorgoni was invited to travel to the
                desert where he photographed Earthworks by Christo and
                Jeanne-Claude, Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt,
                Richard Serra, Robert Smithson, and fifty years later, Ugo
                Rondinone. Gorgoni was the first photographer to collaborate on
                the ground with many of these artists, and his images often
                serve as the definitive photographic record of their
                groundbreaking projects.

                Drawn primarily from the Nevada Museum of Art‚Äôs permanent art
                and archive collections, this exhibition combines work by
                prominent and lesser-known artists whose works interrogate the
                definition of Land Art and question the established canon. While
                much of the world remains enchanted by the monumental land-based
                desert works that emerged in the American West in the late 1960s
                and 70s, there is equal interest among practitioners seeking to
                create, critique, contextualize, perform, and engage in
                environmental and social dialogue about art of the land. Artists
                featured include Lita Albuquerque, Stig Broegger, Judy Chicago,
                Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Agnes Denes, Justin Favela, Regina

                Founded by Andrea Zittel in 2002, High Desert Test Sites (HDTS)
                is a nonprofit arts organization based in Joshua Tree,
                California. Located on 100 acres owned by Zittel, HDTS is
                dedicated to ‚Äúlearning from what we are not‚Äù and the belief that
                learning from the high desert community can offer new insight
                and perspectives, often challenging art to take on new areas of
                relevancy. HDTS is known for its roving biennial events
                featuring artworks installed in diverse desert locations, and
                its programs that include performances, workshops, film
                screenings, publications, residencies, excursions, as well as
                two well-known community-based programs known as Kip‚Äôs Desert
                Book Club and High Desert Test Kitchen. This exhibition features
                highlights from the HDTS archives, recently acquired by the
                Nevada Museum of Art. It is guest curated by Brooke Hodge.

                >One of the most noteworthy responses to the monumental Land Art
                interventions came at the same time as their production.
                Beginning in 1968, the artist Judy Chicago embarked on a series
                of ephemeral Atmospheres performances using colored smokes and
                fireworks in the deserts of the American West that were intended
                to ‚Äúsoften that macho Land Art scene,‚Äù as she puts it. Long
                overlooked by art historians and scholars, Chicago‚Äôs Atmospheres
                series provides a critical counterpoint and essential context to
                the predominantly male Land Artists working in the desert during
                the 1960s and 70s. This exhibition features selections from
                Chicago‚Äôs Fireworks archive that was recently acquired by the
                Nevada Museum of Art in 2018.</small

                Rose B. Simpson presents new work related to her ongoing focus
                on complex issues of past, present and future aspects of Native
                America, including issues surrounding identity and cultural
                survival. Born, raised, and living on the Santa Clara Pueblo in
                New Mexico, Simpson is a rising star in the international
                contemporary art world. Her wide-ranging work includes ceramic
                sculpture, metals, fashion, performance, music, installation,

                they went about historicizing the Land Art genre. A special
                emphasis will be given to the field‚Äôs global roots, and the
                influence of European thinkers and artist including Italian
                photographer Gianfranco Gorgoni (1946-2019) and Italian art
                historian Germano Celant (1940-2020).

                Why does Land Art matter today? In this presentation Lisa Le
                Feuvre, Executive Director of the Holt/Smithson Foundation,
                thinks through how the histories and futures of earthworks can
                help us consider changing place on our planet. Paying particular
                attention to the work of Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson, she
                will propose how the creative legacies of these two artists can
                draw on memory and inspiration to underline, and also complicate
                artistic engagement with the landscape in our present moment.
                Kelly Kivland, Curator of Dia Art Foundation, the New York
                institution responsible for the stewardship of Spiral Jetty and
                Sun Tunnels, will describe current efforts that prioritize
                engagement, build long-term relationships with local
                communities, and acknowledge past erasure of the environment and
                social histories specific to these sites.

                Cauleen Smith‚Äôs film Remote Viewing was made in 2011 in direct
                response to Robert Smithson‚Äôs Partially Buried Woodshed (1970).
                Smithson's installation was made on the campus of Kent State
                University in Ohio, just four months before the Kent State
                massacre. In the early 2000s, Smith‚Äôs research turned to Land
                Art, in particular the disconnect she sensed between the history
                and politics of the sites of major Earthworks. Smith is joined
                by Cameron Shaw, Deputy Director and Chief Curator of the
                California African American Museum, who will facilitate a
                dialogue about how the field of Land Art is ripe for disruption.

                Contemporary artist Justin Favela joins colonial art scholar
                Emmanuel Ortega, Ph.D. to discuss contemporary monuments and how
                Favela‚Äôs creative practice disrupts the conventional boundaries
                of the Land Art canon through subversive tactics rooted in his
                Latinx culture. Favela is the artist behind projects including
                <em>Family Fiesta Double Negative</em>, and
                <em>Seven Magic Tires</em> both located in Las Vegas and made in
                response to Michael Heizer‚Äôs Double Negative and Ugo Rondinone‚Äôs
                Seven Magic Mountains. Both Favela and Ortega aim to deconstruct
                the silences of history that suppress their own narratives.

                Edgar Arceneaux and Julian Myer-Szupinska Ph.D. collaborated for
                nearly a decade on a series of projects related to Land Art,
                Detroit, techno music, and the politics of space. Arceneaux‚Äôs
                interest was on the unresolved problematics resulting from
                Michael Heizer‚Äôs <em>Dragged Mass</em> (1971) at the Detroit Art
                Institute in the years immediately following the Detroit riot of
                1967. Los Angeles-based Arceneaux will discuss this multi-year
                investigation with Julian Myers-Szupinska, a Los Angeles-based
                art historian and editor whose focus is on contemporary art,
                exhibitions, and the politics of space.

                Judy Chicago‚Äôs response to the monumental Earthworks of the
                American West came nearly simultaneous to their production.
                Beginning in 1968, Chicago embarked on a series of ephemeral
                Atmospheres performances using colored smokes and fireworks in
                the desert that were intended to ‚Äúsoften that macho Land Art
                scene.‚Äù Long overlooked by art historians and scholars,
                Chicago‚Äôs Atmospheres offer a critical counterpoint and
                essential context to the predomi- nantly male Land Artists
                working in the desert during the 1960s and 70s. Chicago will be
                in conversation with Chad Alligood, an independent curator and
                art historian who is the former curator at the Crystal Bridges
                Museum of American Art.

                In advance of the 2023 exhibition,
                <em>No Man‚Äôs Land: Women of Land Art</em>, curator Leigh Arnold,
                Ph.D. of the Nasher Sculpture Center leads a conversation with
                artists Mary Miss and Patricia Johanson. Both artists have been
                committed to addressing complex issues of environmental and
                social sustainability in the public realm since the early 1970s.
                <em>No Man‚Äôs Land</em> aims to bring greater visibility to women
                Land Artists whose works often resist commodification and
                recognition within the conventional commercial gallery system.

                Reimagining the future of shared water resources begins with
                understanding sustainable water management strategies rooted in
                Indigenous knowledge. Oscar Tuazon founded the Los Angeles Water
                School in 2018 as a functional public artwork and experimental
                school. Housed in a structure inspired by Steve and Holly Baer‚Äôs
                Zome House (1969-72), the Water School is a site for dialogue
                and engagement with complex water issues. Tuazon is now
                collaborating with Rupert Steele, Chairman of the Confederate
                Tribes of the Goshute Reservation, to establish a public Water
                School near Cedar Springs, Nevada. The underground springs are
                threatened by a proposed $15 billion pipe- line to divert water
                to Las Vegas and beyond.

                Cannupa Hanska Luger and Raven Chacon work outside of
                conventional genres to envision a future where societies live in
                true reverence and acknowledgement of the land. In 2015, as part
                of the Postcommodity collective, Chacon helped realize Repellent
                Fence, a large-scale ephemeral installation along the US-Mexico
                border. The following year at Standing Rock Luger organized
                Mirror Shield Project, a performative action to support the
                efforts of the water protectors, and Chacon began work on an
                experimental sonic score in response to the place and the people
                he encountered. In 2020 Luger directed and Chacon composed the
                music for Sweet Land, an opera that reimagined narratives
                surrounding the colonial founding of America and westward
                expansion.

                as a site for art but also the creativity of the high desert
                community, in 2002 Andrea Zittel and a group of friends founded
                High Desert Test Sites (HDTS), a non-profit organization that
                supports immersive experiences and exchanges among artists,
                critical thinkers, and the public. Since its founding, HDTS has
                hosted more than 450 artists from near and far, 11 expansive
                site-specific programs, and 25 solo projects. Join Brooke Hodge
                and Lisa Anne Auerbach, artist and an HDTS founder, as they
                discuss the history of HDTS and the ways that artists‚Äô projects
                have created community and challenged conventions.

                Artist Andrea Zittel and a group of friends founded High Desert
                Test Sites (HDTS) in 2002 as a roving exhibition of
                site-specific artworks, performances, and readings in the high
                desert near Joshua Tree, California. Brooke Hodge, curator of
                the museum‚Äôs exhibition highlighting the HDTS archive,
                interviews Zittel about High Desert Test Sites, as she prepares
                to hand the non-profit over to new leadership. Hodge and Zittel
                will reflect on the founders‚Äô original vision for HDTS, its
                evolution over the course of almost twenty years, and the impact
                it has had on the creative community in the high desert and
                beyond.

                Rose B. Simpson is a mixed-media artist whose work addresses the
                emotional and existential impacts of our collective humanity.
                Her practice is grounded in the ancestral pottery traditions of
                the Santa Clara Pueblo, where she was born, raised, and
                currently lives. Simpson‚Äôs sculptural works imagine a future
                where there are enhanced connections between realms of the
                psychological, cultural, spiritual, intellectual, and physical.
                It is a future where people are reconnected with land, rather
                than further detached from it.

                During the Art + Environment season, Nevada's PreK-12 educators
                will be invited to participate in professional development
                sessions centered around interdisciplinary approaches to
                education. Sessions will explore modern monuments and extreme
                environments, and will include artist Justin Favela as well as
                content inspired by the work of Judy Chicago. Educators will be
                given an access pass to receive all virtual content of the
                season for free. Additionally, a ten-person cohort of educators
                will collaborate with Museum staff over a three-month period to
                produce lesson plans and education content inspired by the
                season's programs and artists. These future resources will be
                made available to educators through the Art + Environment
                archive.
