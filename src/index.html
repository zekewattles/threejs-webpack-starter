        Commemorating 50 years of Land Art, the Nevada Museum of Art convenes
        its triennial 2021 Art + Environment Season on the subject of Land Art:
        Past, Present, Futures. The three-month season of virtual programs
        brings together prominent artists, art historians, and critics who have
        shaped the pioneering genre, alongside interdisciplinary scholars,
        artists, and social activists who are exploring “what’s next?” as they
        push the boundaries of the field.
